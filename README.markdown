IRLauncher : Launch IR signals from your favorite launcher (Quicksilver, Alfred, ..)
====================================================================================

IRLauncher is a Mac client for [IRKit device](github.com/irkit/device).  
Get one from [Amazon.co.jp](http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B00H91KK26) and set it up before using this.

IRLauncher's purpose is to be the fastest way to control home electronics when you're using a Mac.  
Fastest means not leaving home position on keyboard, obviously.  
I heavily use [Quicksilver](http://qsapp.com/), many others use [Alfred 2](http://www.alfredapp.com/) or Spotlight, so why not send infrared signals utilizing a launcher app?
